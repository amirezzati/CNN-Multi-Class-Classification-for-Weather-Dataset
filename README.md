# CNN-Multi-Class-Classification-for-Weather-Dataset
Multi Class Classiffication with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using Keras on weather photos

# Description
**Project name: Convolutional Neural Network using Keras (Multi Class Classification Weather photos in 4 classes)**

The dataset has weather photos which are related to 4 different classes.     
This project has some Convolutional Neural Network such as Simple CNN, ResNet, and Inception Network to classify this photos.  
    
Neural Networks models implemented by Keras in Tensorflow library.
